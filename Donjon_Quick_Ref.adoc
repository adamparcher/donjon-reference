== The Law of Successes

*1 success = 1 fact or 1 die*

For every success on a roll:

* you can decide to either state one fact about your action
* or carry that success over as a bonus die into another related roll

== Wealth, Provisions, and Items

[cols="1,1"]
|===
2+|*Buying Items*
When you have money burning a hole in your pocket.

h|Player Roll = Wealth Dice (choose up to max) + Sociality
h|Game Master Roll = Item Value + Markup

2+a|*Success:* Item is successfully acquired. Wealth Dice used in roll are removed. +
*Failure:* Wealth Dice are _not_ removed. Merchant will not consider selling to character again until they have acquired more Wealth or circumstances have changed (e.g. have done a favor; increased Sociality)

|===

[cols="1"]
|===
a|*Buying Provisions* +
Buying Provisions is identical to Buying an Item, except when the roll is successful, the player's Provisions dice increases by the number of successes the player had instead of simply acquiring an item.
|===

[cols="1,1"]
|===
2+a|*Buying Influence (aka Bribing)* +
Used to influence or straight-up bribe an NPC. This roll is intended to provide Bonus Dice to a related social attempt, but is not the social attempt itself.

h|Player Roll = Wealth Dice + Sociality
h|Game Master Roll = NPC's Current Wealth + Discernment

2+|*Success:* If you succeed in this roll, you may add the number of successes you received to the number of dice you roll the next time your character attempts any sort of social proposition with the influenced NPC. +
*Failure:* Not explicitly stated in Rules. But NPC is probably not happy.

2+a| *Notes:* +
- NPC does not lose any Wealth in this interaction.
|===

[cols="1,1"]
|===
2+a|*Spending Test for Provisions* +
Used to retrieve a non-magic item from your Provisions. This is a roll that you make when you want to retrieve an item from your backpack or other place of storage. You can only retrieve items that you have already acquired, and you must have enough Provisions to retrieve the item.

h|Player Roll = Provisions + Cerebrality + Abilities
h|Game Master Roll = 3 + Max of Item's Worth OR Item's Ability score + 3(for rare items)

2+|*Success:* If you succeed in this roll, you retrieve the item from your Provisions pool and can use it as normal. Provisions dice used in roll are removed from your Provisions pool. +
*Failure:* The item is not retrieved. Provisions dice used in roll are _not_ removed from your Provisions pool.

2+a| *Notes:* +
- Item's Ability score: If the player wants the item to have an Ability, the score may be set between 1-4. +
- +3(for rare items): If the item is not something you would usually carry, or is too large to fit in a backpack, add 3 to the roll.
|===

== Selling Items

=== Selling for Wealth
Used to sell an item directly in an attempt to increase your Wealth.

*Player Roll = Item's Worth + Sociality*

*Game Master Roll = Player's Current Wealth + Merchant's Markup*

Success: Any successes are added to your Wealth score, and the item is removed from your Provisions.

Failure: The item is removed regardless, and your Wealth score does _not_ increase.

=== Use an Item in Trade
Use an Item in trade as part of a larger transaction, such as buying an item or acquiring Provisions.

Make a Wealth Spending Test, and add the Item's Worth dice to the Player Roll. Item is _not_ lost upon failure. 


== Combat

=== Initiative

Players and NPCs each roll for Initiative using this formula:

*Initiative Roll = Player/NPC Level + Discernment*

* Write down all individual results or keep each die. 

Initiative order is resolved starting at 20, then 19, etc. Ties in Initiative are by highest Adroitness, then Player vs. NPC (Players first). If a Player or NPC has multiple dice for the same Initiative value, they should take one action, then let the rest of the round complete before taking another action.

=== Distance

Distances are:

* Out of range: Cannot attack or be attacked. Out of combat.
* Two actions away: -3 dice to missile weapons; cannot throw weapons or melee
* One action away: no penalty to missile or thrown; cannot melee
* Close: Can melee; -6 penalty to missile or thrown weapons
** If in Close and moving away, an opponent gets a free attack against you. 

It's abstract. Don't overthink it.

=== Movement & Resisting Movement

A Player or NPC can move one distance closer or away from an opponent as their action. 

* If the mover is currently in Close distance and moving away, their opponent gets a free attack.

*Uncontested Movement*: If the opponent is not resisting, the movement happens without interference.

*Resisting Movement*: If an opponent is resisting the movement, both sides roll:

*Roll = Adroitness + any relevant Abilities*

* The resister removes their next initiative die, representing the effort it takes to resist the movement.
* If the mover is successful, they move successfully.
* In either case, successess can be used per the Law of Successes.
* (!) If the Resister wins, they can instead choose to use their Resist Movement successes as bonus dice for their free attack roll.

=== Attacking

*Attacker and Defender Roll = Adroitness + any relevant Abilities*

* NOTE: Weapon Damage Rating is NOT used here.

Defender can choose to Parry or Dodge:

[cols="1,3"]
|===
h|Parry
a| * Defender actively defends with a _melee_ weapon or spell, intending to block and counterattack.
* Only Melee attacks can be Parried.
* Remove the next Initiative die from the Defender's pool, representing the effort it takes to Parry.
* Any successes for the Defender are then used in a Damage Test by the Defender.

h|Dodge
a| * Defender attempts to avoid the attack, but not return damage.
* No initiative die is removed.
* Success means no damage is taken.
|===

=== Damage & Injury

General Tip: Most damage happens as a second roll after a successful action or attack. Per Law of Successes, successes from the first roll can be used as bonus dice in the second roll.

* 1st roll - Player tries to climb cliff, falls down; 2nd roll - Damage Test
* 1st roll - Player attacks with sword, hits; 2nd roll - Damage Test
* 1st roll - Player rolls to disarm trap, fails; 2nd roll - Damage Test
* 1st roll - Player rolls to pick lock, fails; 2nd roll - Damage Test against the lockpick (damage applies to Ability Score of item, which breaks if it reaches 0)

*Attacker Damage Roll = Virility + Weapon Damage Rating + any relevant Abilities*

*Defender Damage Roll = Wherewithal + Armore Damage Rating + any relevant Abilities*

* Successes are applied to Flesh Wounds or Attributes
* For Player attacks, this is up to Player choice. For NPC attacks, damage applies to Flesh Wounds first, then Attributes.
* NPCs fall unconscious at 0 Flesh Wounds. PCs must be Smashed to fall unconscious.

*Smashed* = Damage Test against PC comes up ALL successes

=== Healing

* Automatically heal 1 Flesh Wound or Attribute die at beginning of each scene (Attributes first).
* All damage is healed between Adventures.
* Healing can also be done with items or Magic.

== Magic

Steps to casting a spell:

1. Gather Power
2. Define the Spell - words, area/targets affected, duration
3. Cast the Spell

=== Gathering Power

*Gathering Power Roll = Cerebrality + spellcasting Ability*

*Game Master Roll = Uncontested Action Test*

Success: Add successes to your Spell Dice pool.

Failure: GM can state facts, or apply Bonus Dice against your next Gathering Power roll. Failure on a consecutive Gathering Power roll reduces your Spell Dice pool by the number of the GM's successes.

* Consecutive Gathering Power rolls can be made to increase Spell Dice pool but require you to remove one die from your spellcasting Ability for each consecutive roll.

=== Concentration

Note: The Rules do not call this Concentration, but it does state these tests apply while holding Spell Dice.

* When attempting any active action (e.g. Parry, Attack) other than Dodge, Damage Tests, or Saving Throw Tests, GM adds your Spell Dice to their roll. 

If you take damage while holding Spell Dice, roll:

*Player Roll = Wherewithal + spellcasting Ability*

*Game Master Roll = Spell Dice Player is holding + successes from Damage Test*

* This test is _in addition to_ the Damage Test, and happens regardless of whether the opponent actually had any successes.

Success: You retain your Spell Dice pool.

Failure: You lose your Spell Dice pool, and you and everyone Close must make a Damage Test against your Spell Dice.

=== Casting a Spell

* Words give the spell its effects. Each word implies a specific effect and a separate roll.
* Give your spell a name.
* Let 'er rip!

*Spell Casting Roll = Cerebrality + spellcasting Ability + Spell Dice*

*Game Master Roll = Depends on effect of spell*

Examples of Game Master Rolls:

* Spell Effect: Fire damage, GM rolls Damage Test against Spell Casting Roll
* Spell Effect: Transmorph into chicken, GM rolls Wherewithal + Save vs. Poison, Polymorph, and Transmogrification
* Spell Effect: Teleport across a chasm, GM rolls Uncontested Action Test

Success: Spell is cast, and successes are applied as facts or affecting abilities. Where logical, these last for the duration of the spell (e.g. healing is permanent, but a -1 to an opponent's Adroitness is only for the duration of the spell).

Failure: GM successes can be used to state facts or apply Bonus Dice. Highly subjective, e.g. you still summoned the demon, but maybe it doesn't listen to you...

=== Creating Magic Items

Rules for creating Magic Items:

* The item's qualities must fit within the caster's Words
* Magic Items can only be created between Adventures

Steps: 

1. Spending Wealth eqaul to the item's Worth
2. Roll for Gathering Power as normal
3. Roll *Cerebrality + spellcasting Ability + Spell Dice* vs the *Item's Worth - Curse Dice*

Success: Item is created. Any successes represent leftover materials and are added back into your Wealth.

Failure: Item is not created. GM successes represent the additional cost of materials required to try creating the item again. You can try again, but you must pay the additional cost in Wealth.

* Player may choose to add Curse Dice to reduce the Item's Worth, but the GM always decides what the Curse is.

== Loot

When an NPC or monster is defeated, the Player can loot it for Items or Wealth. Each corpse can only be looted by a single Player.

When the party finds a treasure cache (chest, hollowed out tree, giant bird's nest, etc.), each Player gets a chance to loot it.

=== Looting for Wealth

*Player Roll = Opponent's Level*

*Game Master Roll = Player's Current Wealth*

Success: Any successes are added to your Wealth.

Failure: Player does not gain Wealth and cannot loot that corpse or treasure cache again.

* Note the reverseal of the usual - Player is rolling against the NPC's Level, and the GM is rolling the Player's Wealth.

=== Looting for Items

Player must decide what they are looking for, and the total Item Worth.

*Player Roll = Opponent's Level*

*Game Master Roll = Item Worth*

Success: Player finds the item.

Failure: Player finds nothing and cannot search that corpse or treasure cache again.

* Also see tables for Armor and Weapon Damage Ratings

== Advancement

At the end of each Adventure, XP is added up and new levels are gained according to the following table. 

* Each new level awards 5 Dice that can be applied to any Ability, Saving Throw, or Flesh Wounds. None of these can exceed Level + 3.
* Also see New character qualities listed for specific levels in the table below.
